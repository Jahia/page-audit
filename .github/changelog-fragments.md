# Changelog fragments

The customer-facing changelog of this module is assembled from the fragment files in this
folder. Do not hand-edit `CHANGELOG.md` at the repository root: the
`Chachalog - Prepare Changelog` workflow aggregates these fragments into it and opens a
"prepare next release" pull request that also bumps `.chachalog/.version`.

Add one fragment per user-facing pull request, in a file with a **random** name:

```markdown
---
# Allowed version bumps: patch, minor, major
page-audit: minor
---

Added a Copy button to every AI suggestion so editors can paste straight into Content Editor.
```

- The package name is the Maven `artifactId`: `page-audit`.
- The bump matches the version line in development, read from the `-SNAPSHOT` in `pom.xml`
  (`1.2.0-SNAPSHOT` → `minor`, `1.2.1-SNAPSHOT` → `patch`, a breaking change → `major`).
- A fragment is only needed when the change is visible to a user. Pure refactors, tests, CI
  and docs need none — the `check-changelog` gate already exempts `.github/**`, `tests/**`
  and `**/*.md`.
- Write the note per `.github/instructions/changelog.instructions.md`: one past-tense sentence
  under 120 characters, outcomes rather than internals, no class or method names.

`.version` holds the last released version, and is maintained by the release pull request
chachalog opens.

This guide lives in `.github/` rather than in `.chachalog/`, because chachalog treats **every**
markdown file in that folder as a fragment: a README kept there is consumed and deleted by the
first release that runs.
